# Kubernetes Cluster Issue Prevention and Remediation
## An ML-Powered Automated Solution

---

## Project Overview

- **Phase 1**: Prediction of potential cluster issues
- **Phase 2**: Automated remediation of predicted issues
- Integration of both phases for end-to-end automation

---

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/architecture.png)

1. ML Agent predicts potential issues
2. Remediation Agent receives predictions
3. Automated actions are taken
4. Results are monitored and evaluated

---

## Phase 1: Prediction

- ML model trained on historical cluster data
- Predicts three types of issues:
  - Resource exhaustion
  - Node failures
  - Resource bottlenecks
- Provides confidence scores for predictions

---

## Phase 2: Remediation

### Automated Actions:
1. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Automatic pod scaling
   - Based on predicted usage increase

2. **Node Failures**
   - Proactive pod relocation
   - Prevents service disruption

3. **Resource Bottlenecks**
   - Dynamic resource optimization
   - CPU and memory adjustment

---

## Integration

### Prediction â†’ Remediation Flow:
```json
{
  "issue_type": "resource_exhaustion",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "target": {
    "deployment": "web-app",
    "namespace": "production",
    "current_replicas": 3
  },
  "details": {
    "usage_increase": 1.8
  }
}
```

### Demo Scenarios:
1. Resource exhaustion prediction and scaling
2. Node failure prediction and pod relocation
3. Resource optimization in action

---

## Results

- **Success Rate**: [X]% of issues prevented
- **Response Time**: Average [Y]ms remediation time
- **Resource Efficiency**: [Z]% improvement in resource utilization
- **False Positives**: Less than [W]% false positive rate

---

## Future Improvements

1. Enhanced prediction accuracy
2. More sophisticated remediation strategies
3. Integration with additional data sources
4. Extended monitoring capabilities
